Build a text based adventure game!
You find yourself walking down a forest path there are birds chirping, trees are moving slowly in the wind. As you round a corner in path you see the opening to a cave . It is wet, covered with vines and moss little ferns are growing along the face of the cave wall. 

Something stirs within you, pulling you toward the cave entrance. As you get near a strong gust of wind comes from within the cave. It is not musty as you would expect coming from within a cave, but it carries a crisp freshness to it and the sent of salt.

What would you like to do; enter the cave or go back to the trail?

1. :go back to the trail
    - You turn around and leave the mouth of the cave. As you do everything becomes still and quiet. Almost as if some one hit the pause button on the world. A bad feeling settles into the bottom of your stomach. You continue to walk back toward the main trail but you don’t seem to be getting any closer to it.
	
    - Would you like to keep going or turn back towards the 	cave?
        1. :keep going
            - You continue to head toward the tail but do not seem to be making any progress.
        2. :Turn back towards the cave
            - You turn around to find that you are closer to the cave entrance then before
2. :enter the cave
    - You walk through the entrance of the cave.
