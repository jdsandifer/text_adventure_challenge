# Text Adventure Challenge
This was a challenge problem at a meetup that I and two others worked on together.

### The Challenge

The task was to create a basic text adventure game. The player should be able to enter commands like "go north" to move around the world and interact with items in the world like this: "pick up candy" or "drop ball". The world is only described through text printed to the screen.

The game should include at least four rooms/areas, one item to pick up, and a condition that could be met to win the game. Everything else was up to us to decide.



### Optional Prompt

The optional prompt for the challenge was this ( we didn't end up using it, but it gives an example of basic gameplay expectations ):

You find yourself walking down a forest path there are birds chirping, trees are moving slowly in the wind. As you round a corner in path you see the opening to a cave. It is wet, covered with vines and moss. Little ferns are growing along the face of the cave wall. 

Something stirs within you, pulling you toward the cave entrance. As you get near a strong gust of wind comes from within the cave. It is not musty as you would expect coming from within a cave, but it carries a crisp freshness to it and the sent of salt.

What would you like to do; enter the cave or go back to the trail?

1. :go back to the trail
    - You turn around and leave the mouth of the cave. As you do everything becomes still and quiet. Almost as if some one hit the pause button on the world. A bad feeling settles into the bottom of your stomach. You continue to walk back toward the main trail but you donâ€™t seem to be getting any closer to it.
	
    - Would you like to keep going or turn back towards the 	cave?
        1. :keep going
            - You continue to head toward the tail but do not seem to be making any progress.
        2. :Turn back towards the cave
            - You turn around to find that you are closer to the cave entrance then before
2. :enter the cave
    - You walk through the entrance of the cave.
